# FIFO Adder System
A simple C++ console-based system that simulates a FIFO-based adder using queues.The program loads elements from two input vectors into FIFO buffers and performs pairwise addition based on user commands.
The final results are stored in a third vector and displayed at the end.
## Features
FIFO buffer implementation using std::queue

Object-Oriented Design (OOP)

Industry-style command interface

Exception handling for underflow

Stores final results in a separate output vector

Clean and maintainable code structure
